      <p>
        The mfkey32 attack is a method to retrieve the keys of MF Classic cards
        by using the nonces gathered during the communication between the card
        and the reader. The attack is based on the fact that the nonces are
        generated using a weak random number generator, which allows an attacker
        to recover the keys by analyzing the nonces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saved nonces are stored in the log file on Flipper's SD card. We are
        feeding nonces one by one into mfkey32, looking for new keys. Once
        discovered, new keys will be added to the user dictionary file and will
        be available for future cracks.
      </p>
      <p>You can also run the attack by entering the nonce manually.</p>
